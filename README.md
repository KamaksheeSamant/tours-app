# App Generated to browse available tours 

This project is an implementation of server-side rendering with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB using the Mongoose driver. The UI is designed to load server-side, which improves the initial page load time and search engine optimization. 
This app has been created to practically implement and learn specified technologies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies:

3. Set up MongoDB by installing it and starting it as a service. 

4. In `config/config.js`, set the MongoDB URL and port number. 

5. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
